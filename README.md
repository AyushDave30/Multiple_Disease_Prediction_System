# Multiple Disease Prediction App  
A machine learning-based web app for predicting diseases using health parameters.  

Hi there! Welcome to my project, where I’m learning Data Science by building a **Multiple Disease Prediction App** from scratch. This project is inspired by **@siddhardhan's YouTube tutorial**, and I’ve added insights, explanations, and extra features to enhance learning.  

Currently, the app can predict:  
- **Heart Disease**  
- **Diabetes**  

It’s built with **Streamlit** for an interactive interface, and uses **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** models trained on public datasets. You just input health data, and the app tells you whether you might be at risk.  

Let’s explore, experiment, and improve the app together! More diseases and better models are coming soon.  

## Tech Stack:  
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pickle (for model storage)  

## Features:  
- Simple and easy-to-use web interface  
- Instant predictions based on user input  
- Scalable framework to add more disease models  

This project is in its early stages, and I’m excited to keep learning and improving it. Suggestions and feedback are always welcome!
